# My AI Journey:

A dedicated repository for documenting my progress in Machine Learning.

## 📑 Log Index
* [Day 43: Backpropagation & Hidden Layers](./logs/day1-or-43.md) - Deep dive into Softmax, Cross-Entropy, and the first "Secret" layer.
* [Day 44: Momentum & Independent Bias](./logs/day-2.md) - Introducing physics into gradient descent.
* [Day 46: The Hardcore Optimizer & ML Battle](./logs/day-3.md) - Regularization, Large Margin, and comparing Neural Nets with SVM/KNN.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Pure Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** `math`, `random` (No frameworks, just math).
- **Goal:** Understand the "Why" behind the "How."
